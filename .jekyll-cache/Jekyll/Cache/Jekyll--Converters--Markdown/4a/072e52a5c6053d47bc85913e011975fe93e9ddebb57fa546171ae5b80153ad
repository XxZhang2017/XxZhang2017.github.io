I"q<p>Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. Usually dataset in machine learning goes through these stages, Raw data process, Structured data, Data preprocessing, Exploration data analysis(EDA), insight, reports, Visual graphs.</p>

<p>The important processes in data preprocessing includes as follow:
1, Rescale data:
You know that many machine learning algorithms can benefit from rescaling the attributes to all have the same scale. As it is mentioned by  , This is useful for optimization algorithms in used in the core of machine learning algorithms like gradient descent.</p>

<p>2, Standardize Data:
Standardization is a useful technique to transform attributes with a Gaussian distribution and differing means and standard deviations to a standard Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1</p>
